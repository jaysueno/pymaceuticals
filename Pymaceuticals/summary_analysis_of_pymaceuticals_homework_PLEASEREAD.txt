Summary analysis with observations and insights of the study:
create 3 observations and insights
1. There is a postitive correlation between the weight of the mice and the tumor size. The P-Value of .84 indicates this linear correlation. Therefore, we might want to keep the mice on a healthy diet and provide exercise to help them decrease tumor size.
2. Capomulin seems to be an effective drug regimen to treat the cancer. The tumor size in mouse l509 decreased as time went on. 
3. Of the 4 drug regimens we analyized, Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective at decreasing tumor size. The least effective were the other two drugs Infubinol and Ceftamin. Therefore, I would recommend we do further studies or advance the two effective drugs to the next stage of trials.
